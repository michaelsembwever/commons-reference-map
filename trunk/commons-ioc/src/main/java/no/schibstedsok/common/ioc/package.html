This package provides a supporting utility, ContextWrapper, for Inversion of 
Control pattern in schibsted søk code.
</p>

<p>
This is a pure design pattern that is independant of IoC frameworks.
<br/>
For more information read 
<a href="http://www.theserverside.com/articles/content/IOCandEJB/article.html">Examining the validity of Inversion of Control</a>
</p>

<p>
Each class that requires dependencies defines these dependencies in an inner 
interface named "Context".
The class then accepts an implementation of this Context in it's constructor(s) 
and uses the context to perform those dependencies that it should not take 
responsibility for.
</p>

<p>
The major flaw, and hence reason for this package, is that, because the 
contextual IoC requires you to implement the Context in the calling code, the 
calling code ends up very verbose with lots of anonymous classes inside 
constructor calls. In a highly depth-wise IoC implementation many of these Context
anonymous class implementations will just be delegating to the next context(s) up.
<br/>
This last verbosity explosion can be avoided by using the ContextWrapper utility
to create a java.util.reflect.Proxy class implementing the required Context and
automatically delegating back to the next context(s) up.
</p>

<p>
One requirement of ContextWrapper is that the returning context and list of contexts
that will be delegated to must all extend the BaseContext interface.
<br/>
This is solely for type-safety.
